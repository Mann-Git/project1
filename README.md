# Getting Started with Create React App

CodeWithHarry project 1 on his ReactJs Playlist

(understanding in my language) 


component : you make a function like Navbar.js and export it to the App.js like <Navbar /> : so this thing is called a single component.
(you can reuse the component using ->  [ import and < /> ]  )


props : full name -> properties (function ke bracket me jo attributes hote hai vaisa)
Parent component se child component ko data pass karna : so this is called props
