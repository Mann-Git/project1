### This project is a part of my learning journey where I'm exploring and practicing React.js. While building this application, I'm gradually understanding core concepts like components, props, state, and JSX. It's a hands-on approach to improve my skills and get better at frontend development using React.

(understanding in my language) 


component : you make a function like Navbar.js and export it to the App.js like <Navbar /> : so this thing is called a single component.
(you can reuse the component using ->  [ import and < /> ]  )


props : full name -> properties (function ke bracket me jo attributes hote hai vaisa)
Parent component se child component ko data pass karna : so this is called props 

propTypes : it is used to check the type of the props 
example : if you used string as propTypes on the title and you put only number on the title by mistake -> it will show the error on the console (so you can fix the minor bugs/errors)
